#after creating model, we should conduct performance evalution,
#their are seperate performance evalution for classification and regression
#   four evalution methods are their in classicifation

# 1) Accuracy score  ==== (TP+TN)/TP+TN+FP+FN
# 2) Recall   === It is used to give importance to false negatives, It is inversely proportional to false negative
#                   TP/TP+FN
# 3) Precision === It is used to give importance to false positive, It is inversely proportional to false positive
#                   TP/TP+FP
# 4) F1_score === It is a combination of recall and precision in a balanced performance mesurement
#                   F1_score = 2((Recall * Precision)/(Recall + precision))

# in classification evauation their performance is evaluted using a matrics called 'confusion matrics'
# 4 techinical terms in confusion matrics are :


#                                   y_test        y_pred
#       TP : True Positive             1  =======>  1                           
#       TN : True Negative             0  =======>  0
#       FP : False Positive            0  =======>  1
#       FN : False Negative            1  =======>  0
