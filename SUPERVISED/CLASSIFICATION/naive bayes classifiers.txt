# in naive bayes algorithm, 3 types of classifiers are their

#1) Gaussian() ===> used when if the data is continous (all data are numeric)
#2) Multinomial() ===> used when if the data is discret (data contains objects)
#3) Bernouli() ===> used in both situation (it is used when negative values object are present in data, soo Multinomial not work )
